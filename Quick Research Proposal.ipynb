    "We should establish which planets we want to target for the advertising campaign. We should establish two groups of 5 planets THERE SHOULD BE A LOT MORE IN THE GALAXY THAT CAN BE USED TO INCREASE THE STATISTICAL POWER. Each of the planets in the group should have a corresponding planet in the other group with similar sentiment to the empire, population, financial make up and well as race. Once these planets have been established we can launch two campaigns with the exact same budgets and tactics - with the only distinguishable difference being the slogan. The effectiveness of the campaigns will be determined by the number of new recruits produced from each campaign.
